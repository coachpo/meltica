# Deployments

This directory contains deployment configurations and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for various environments.

## Structure

Organize by deployment target or environment:
- `docker/` - Docker Compose configurations
- `kubernetes/` - Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- `terraform/` - Infrastructure provisioning scripts
- `ansible/` - Configuration management playbooks

## Purpose

Maintain deployment-specific configurations separate from application code to support:
- Multiple deployment environments (dev, staging, production)
- Infrastructure as Code practices
- Reproducible deployments
- Environment-specific settings

## Usage

Reference these configurations in CI/CD pipelines or use them for manual deployments.
