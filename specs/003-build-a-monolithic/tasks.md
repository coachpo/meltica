## Phase 12: Quality Assurance & CI Enforcement

**Purpose**: Enforce ‚â•70% coverage, timeouts, race detection, and no backward-compat code

### Coverage Enforcement

- [ ] **T174** [QA] Configure `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out` in CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] **T175** [QA] Add coverage threshold check: fail build if <70% in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- [ ] **T188** [QA] Enforce gofmt and goimports in CI
- [ ] **T189** [QA] Run `go vet` in CI

**Checkpoint**: Quality gates enforced - all builds must pass 70% coverage, timeouts, race detector, and no backward-compat

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Additional Providers (Phase 10)**: Can start after US1 (provider template exists)
- **Observability (Phase 11)**: Can start after Foundational, parallel with user stories
- **QA & CI (Phase 12)**: Continuous throughout, finalized after all user stories
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs basic event flow) and US2 (needs subscription management)
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Depends on US4 (needs order submission path)
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 but independent
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (needs event dispatch infrastructure)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Models/schemas before services
- Services before handlers
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T013) marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational schemas (T014-T020) marked [P] can run in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1, US2, US4, US6 can all start in parallel (independent)
  - US3 can start after US1+US2 complete
  - US5 can start after US4 completes
  - US7 can start after US1 completes
- All tests within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Providers (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) marked [P] can be implemented in parallel
- Observability tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Market Data Consumption)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD - write first, ensure FAIL):
Task: "Unit test: Provider WebSocket connection lifecycle"
Task: "Unit test: Provider REST snapshot fetcher"
Task: "Unit test: Canonical event parsing"
Task: "Unit test: Dispatcher per-stream ordering"
Task: "Integration test: End-to-end market data delivery"

# After tests fail, launch all provider template tasks together:
Task: "Create provider module template with WS client interface"
Task: "Create provider module template with REST client interface"
Task: "Create provider module template with adapter interface"

# Implement Binance provider sequentially (dependencies):
Task: "Implement Binance WebSocket client"
Task: "Implement Binance REST client"
Task: "Implement Binance parser" [P with REST client]
Task: "Emit canonical events"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories After Foundational

```bash
# Team A: User Story 1 (Market Data Consumption)
# Team B: User Story 2 (Subscription Management)
# Team C: User Story 4 (Order Submission)
# Team D: User Story 6 (Book Assembly)

# All four teams can work in parallel after Phase 2 (Foundational) completes

# Once US1 + US2 complete:
# Team A: User Story 3 (Merged Streams)

# Once US4 completes:
# Team C: User Story 5 (Execution Reports)

# Once US1 completes:
# Team A: User Story 7 (Fair-Share Backpressure)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (diagrams, project structure)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (market data consumption)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently (subscribe ‚Üí receive events)
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for experienced Go developer

### Incremental Delivery (P1 Stories)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (dynamic subscriptions)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (order submission)
5. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (execution reports)
6. **P1 Feature-Complete**: All critical trading functionality operational

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 weeks for experienced Go developer

### Full Feature Set (All Stories P1-P3)

1. Complete P1 stories (US1, US2, US4, US5)
2. Add User Story 6 (book assembly) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 3 (merged streams) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 7 (fair-share backpressure) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add additional providers (Coinbase, Kraken)
6. Finalize observability and QA enforcement

**Time Estimate**: 8-12 weeks for experienced Go developer

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Week 1-2**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. **Week 3-4**: Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (market data)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (subscriptions)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (orders)
   - Developer D: User Story 6 (book assembly)
3. **Week 5**: Stories complete and integrate independently
4. **Week 6**: Developer A adds US3 (merged streams), Developer C adds US5 (exec reports)
5. **Week 7-8**: Developer A adds US7 (backpressure), team adds additional providers
6. **Week 9-10**: Polish, observability, QA enforcement

**Time Estimate**: 8-10 weeks with 4 developers

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Verify tests fail**: Before implementing (TDD approach)
- **Commit strategy**: After each task or logical group
- **Checkpoints**: Stop to validate story independently
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

### Constitution Compliance Reminders

- **LM-01**: Maintain immutable boundaries: Providers ‚Üí Orchestrator ‚Üí Dispatcher ‚Üí Consumers
- **LM-02**: Use canonical, versioned event schemas; merged events are first-class
- **LM-03**: Enforce per-stream ordering with seq_provider buffer + ingest_ts fallback
- **LM-04**: Latest-wins coalescing for market data; NEVER drop ExecReport
- **LM-05**: Windowed merge: open on first, close by time/count, late=drop, partial=suppress
- **LM-06**: Idempotent orders via client_order_id; lossless ExecReport path
- **LM-07**: Provider-side book assembly: snapshot+diff, checksums, periodic refresh
- **LM-08**: Ops-only telemetry with trace_id/decision_id; consumers don't ingest telemetry
- **LM-09**: Discard in-flight merges on restart; no replay
- **CQ-08/GOV-04**: NO backward compatibility coding; break APIs freely
- **TS-01-05**: ‚â•70% coverage, timeouts, -race, IO isolation in tests
- **ARCH-01/02**: Keep reusable infrastructure in `/lib`
