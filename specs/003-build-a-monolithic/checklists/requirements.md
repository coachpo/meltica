# Specification Quality Checklist: Monolithic Auto-Trading Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec describes *what* the system does (canonical events, windowed merge, per-stream ordering) without specifying *how* to implement (no Go code, no specific libraries)
- ✅ Each user story articulates business value and trading use cases
- ✅ Language is accessible to product managers and business stakeholders
- ✅ All three mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ All 42 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., FR-013 "System MUST enforce per-stream ordering where stream key is (provider, symbol, eventType)")
- ✅ All 12 success criteria include quantifiable metrics (e.g., SC-001 "under 200ms (p99)", SC-003 "100% of execution reports")
- ✅ Success criteria describe outcomes from user perspective without mentioning technology stack (e.g., "delivers events with latency under 200ms" not "Redis pub/sub achieves 200ms")
- ✅ All 7 user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified covering connection drops, partial merges, duplicate IDs, window closure, idempotent commands, and DLQ overflow
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded: "monolithic auto-trading application (non-HFT, loss-tolerant)" with specific component boundaries from architecture diagram
- ✅ Dependencies implicit in architecture (providers, control bus, data bus); assumptions about latency and throughput targets derived from UML diagram specifications

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement is verifiable (e.g., FR-014 can be tested by injecting out-of-order events and verifying reordering by seq_provider)
- ✅ Seven prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover the complete trading lifecycle: market data consumption, subscription management, merged streams, order submission, execution reporting, book assembly, and fair-share management
- ✅ 12 success criteria provide measurable targets (latency, throughput, accuracy, fairness) that directly correspond to functional requirements
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction: describes "canonical events," "windowed merge," "per-stream ordering" as behavioral requirements, not implementation choices

## Notes

- **Architecture Diagram**: The PlantUML diagram is included as the authoritative system design, replacing any previous drafts. All functional requirements trace to diagram components (Providers, Orchestrator, Dispatcher, Control Bus, Data Bus, Consumers).
- **Non-HFT Positioning**: The "loss-tolerant" and "non-HFT" constraints appropriately relax requirements - the spec allows best-effort ordering (150ms lateness tolerance) and coalescable event dropping, which would be unacceptable in HFT systems.
- **Ready for `/speckit.plan`**: All checklist items pass. No spec updates required. Feature is ready for planning phase.
