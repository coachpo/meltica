# Tasks: Performance & Memory Architecture Upgrade

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-upgrade-non-functional/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests included per specification requirements (unit tests for Reset(), integration tests for pooling, benchmarks for performance validation)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Go monolithic project**: `internal/`, `lib/`, `tests/` at repository root
- All paths are absolute or relative to repository root

---

- [X] T068 [US3] Add -race integration test job in CI that runs for 5 minutes under load

**Checkpoint**: All user stories (US1, US2, US3) should now be independently functional with safety guarantees

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Enforced Library Standards (Priority: P2)

**Checkpoint**: CI enforcement prevents library regressions

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

### Documentation

- [X] T077 [P] Update README.md to reflect coder/websocket and goccy/go-json usage
- [X] T078 [P] Add MIGRATION.md documenting library changes and breaking changes
- [X] T079 [P] Update docs/architecture.md with pooling architecture diagrams
- [X] T080 [P] Add inline documentation for pool lifecycle in internal/pool/manager.go

### Migration Cleanup

- [X] T081 [P] Verify all gorilla/websocket imports removed
  - Run: `grep -rn 'gorilla/websocket' --include='*.go' internal/ cmd/ lib/ || echo "‚úì PASS: No gorilla/websocket imports found"`
  - If found: Remove remaining imports and replace with coder/websocket
  - Expected: No matches (PASS message)

- [X] T082 [P] Verify all encoding/json imports removed
  - Run: `grep -rn '"encoding/json"' --include='*.go' internal/ cmd/ lib/ || echo "‚úì PASS: No encoding/json imports found"`
  - Exclude: vendor/, tests/ (test files may mock encoding/json for equivalence tests)
  - If found: Replace with `json "github.com/goccy/go-json"`
  - Expected: No matches in production code (PASS message)

- [X] T083 [P] Verify no backward compatibility shims or feature flags exist
  - Run: `grep -rn 'compat\|legacy\|deprecated.*pool\|USE_OLD' --include='*.go' internal/ || echo "‚úì PASS: No compat code found"`
  - Expected: No matches (none expected per CQ-08/GOV-04)

- [X] T084 Remove unused gorilla/websocket from go.mod if no transitive dependencies
  - Run: `go mod tidy` then verify `go.mod` has no gorilla/websocket entry
  - Note: May remain if transitive dependency; verify not directly imported

### Performance Validation

- [X] T085 [P] Capture performance baseline metrics (run benchmarks before pooling, save to baseline.txt)
- [X] T086 [P] Run post-upgrade benchmarks (save to upgraded.txt)
- [X] T087 Compare baseline vs upgraded using benchstat tool, verify targets met:
  - 40% allocation reduction
  - 30% faster JSON parsing
  - 20% reduced WS overhead
  - p99 latency <150ms
  - p99 GC pause <10ms

### Code Quality

- [X] T088 [P] Run golangci-lint locally and fix any issues
- [X] T089 [P] Run go vet ./... and address findings
- [X] T090 Ensure test coverage ‚â•70% (run go test -cover ./...)

### Final Validation

- [X] T091 Run quickstart.md validation steps to ensure guide is accurate
- [X] T092 Execute 24-hour soak test with varying load patterns (50-150 symbols)
- [X] T093 Verify all success criteria met (SC-001 through SC-009 from spec.md)

### Additional Verification & Pooling Tasks

#### Clone Ownership Verification

- [X] T094 [US3] Verify no Put() calls on heap clones in consumer code
  - Run: `grep -rn "\.Put(" internal/consumer/ | grep -E "(CanonicalEvent|MergedEvent|ExecReport)" || echo "‚úì PASS: No Put() on clones found"`
  - Expected: No matches (empty output or PASS message)
  - If matches found: Review and remove incorrect Put() calls on clones
  - Rationale: Consumers own heap clones until GC; calling Put() would cause panic or pool corruption

#### Complete OrderRequest/ExecReport Pooling

- [X] T095 [US1] Update order request creation to Get() pooled OrderRequest with 100ms timeout
  - Location: Order creation code (internal/dispatcher/ or internal/conductor/)
  - Pattern: Get() ‚Üí populate ‚Üí send ‚Üí defer Put()
  - Expected: OrderRequest lifecycle matches other pooled types (WsFrame, CanonicalEvent, etc.)

- [X] T096 [US1] Update execution report handling to Get() pooled ExecReport with 100ms timeout
  - Location: Provider response handler (internal/adapters/binance/)
  - Pattern: Get() ‚Üí parse response ‚Üí route ‚Üí defer Put()
  - Expected: ExecReport lifecycle matches other pooled types

- [X] T097 [P] [US1] Unit test for OrderRequest pooling in tests/unit/pool_lifecycle_test.go
  - Verify: Get/Put balanced, no leaks, timeout handling
  - Pattern: Same as tests T016-T021 for other pooled types

- [X] T098 [P] [US1] Unit test for ExecReport pooling in tests/unit/pool_lifecycle_test.go
  - Verify: Get/Put balanced, no leaks, timeout handling
  - Pattern: Same as tests T016-T021 for other pooled types

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1, US2, US3 can proceed in parallel (if staffed) - all P1 priority
  - US4 depends on US2 completion (needs library migration done first)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (library migration must be done to enforce standards)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (unit/integration) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Pool infrastructure (Foundational) before pool usage
- Library replacements can happen independently
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup**: All T001-T004 can run in parallel
- **Foundational**: 
  - T005-T008 (pool infrastructure) can run in parallel
  - T009-T014 (Reset() methods) can run in parallel
  - T015 runs after T009-T014 complete
- **US1 Tests**: T016-T023 can all run in parallel (different test cases)
- **US2 Tests**: T041-T044 can all run in parallel
- **US2 WebSocket Migration**: T045-T049 are in same file (sequential)
- **US2 JSON Migration**: T050-T053 can run in parallel (different files)
- **US3 Tests**: T058-T060 can run in parallel
- **US4 CI Rules**: T069-T071 can run in parallel
- **US4 Tests**: T074-T076 can run in parallel
- **Polish Docs**: T077-T080 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for WsFrame.Reset() - verify all fields zeroed"
Task: "Unit test for ProviderRaw.Reset() - verify all fields zeroed"
Task: "Unit test for CanonicalEvent.Reset() - verify all fields zeroed"
Task: "Unit test for MergedEvent.Reset() - verify all fields zeroed"
Task: "Unit test for OrderRequest.Reset() - verify all fields zeroed"
Task: "Unit test for ExecReport.Reset() - verify all fields zeroed"
Task: "Unit test for double-Put() panic - verify panic with stack trace"
Task: "Unit test for pool exhaustion timeout - verify context.DeadlineExceeded"

# After tests fail, launch consumer updates in parallel:
Task: "Update consumer handlers to process heap clones without Put()"
Task: "Add documentation comments explaining clone ownership"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T015) - CRITICAL blocking phase
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T040)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently - verify memory footprint reduction
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP: Memory Efficiency!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP + Latency!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP + Safety!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full Feature!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (MUST be done first)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Memory Pooling)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Library Migration)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Safety & Shutdown)
3. Developer D: User Story 4 after US2 completes
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label (US1, US2, US3, US4) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Pool infrastructure (Foundational Phase 2) is CRITICAL - all pooling depends on it
- Library migration (US2) can happen independently of pooling (US1)
- CI enforcement (US4) requires library migration (US2) to be complete first
- Debug build field poisoning helps catch pool misuse during development
- 24-hour leak test (US3) should run in background/overnight
- Benchmarking (Phase 7) validates all performance targets from spec
- Breaking changes are acceptable per CQ-08/GOV-04 - no shims or backward compat needed
- Tasks T094-T098 added per analysis recommendations to close coverage gaps (clone verification, OrderRequest/ExecReport pooling)
