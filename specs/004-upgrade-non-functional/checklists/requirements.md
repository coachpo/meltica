# Specification Quality Checklist: Performance & Memory Architecture Upgrade

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: 
- Spec correctly focuses on observable outcomes (latency, memory usage, leak prevention) rather than implementation
- User stories are from operator/developer perspective which is appropriate for infrastructure upgrade
- Technical terms (sync.Pool, struct names) appear only in requirements section which is acceptable for technical features
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- No clarification markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each FR is testable (can verify library replacement, pool implementation, CI enforcement)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (40% reduction, <150ms p99, 30% improvement, etc.)
- Success criteria focus on outcomes (allocation reduction, latency, leak-free operation) not implementation
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are specific
- Edge cases cover pool lifecycle issues, memory safety, shutdown scenarios
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the work
- Assumptions and Dependencies sections are comprehensive

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- Each user story has acceptance scenarios that align with the functional requirements
- Four user stories cover the core value: memory efficiency, latency, safety, enforcement
- Success criteria are directly traceable to user story benefits
- Requirements section appropriately includes technical details but user scenarios remain outcome-focused

## Validation Status

**PASSED** âœ…

All quality criteria met. Specification is ready for planning phase.

## Notes

- Spec successfully captures a technical infrastructure upgrade in terms of observable benefits
- Clear distinction between what (outcomes) and how (implementation) is maintained
- Measurement criteria are specific and verifiable
- No outstanding issues requiring spec updates
