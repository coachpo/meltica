# Tasks: Event Distribution & Lifecycle Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-scope-of-upgrade/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Core components**: `/home/qing/work/meltica/core/`
- **Tests**: `/home/qing/work/meltica/tests/`
- **Documentation**: `/home/qing/work/meltica/specs/005-scope-of-upgrade/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Phase 3) can start after Foundational
  - US2 (Phase 4) can start after Foundational (uses Recycler from Phase 2)
  - US3 (Phase 5) can start after Foundational (uses ConsumerWrapper from US2 Phase 4)
  - US4 (Phase 6) can start after Foundational (modifies Dispatcher from US1 Phase 3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Success Criteria Validation (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories and polish being complete; validates spec.md measurable outcomes

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (but creates ConsumerWrapper used by US3)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Soft dependency on US2 (extends ConsumerWrapper) - Can be developed in parallel but easier after US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Soft dependency on US1 (migrates Dispatcher pools) - Can be merged with US1 implementation

### Within Each User Story

- Foundational Phase: All Recycler tasks (T005-T021) sequential within component
- US1: Dispatcher modifications sequential within fanout.go
- US2: ConsumerWrapper creation before Orchestrator integration
- US3: ConsumerWrapper extension after base implementation
- US4: Audit before migration, migration before cleanup
- Polish: All tasks can run in parallel except final validations

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:
```bash
# Launch all setup tasks together:
Task T001: Add conc dependency
Task T002: Add goleak dependency  
Task T003: Update CI banned imports
Task T004: Create recycler directory
```

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2)**:
```bash
# Parallel within sub-components:
Parallel Group A (Event types):
  Task T005: Create EventKind enum
  Task T006: Add RoutingVersion field

Parallel Group B (Recycler interface + debug):
  Task T007-T011: Recycler interface and implementation
  Task T012-T013: Debug poisoning and double-put guard (separate file)
  Task T016-T017: Metrics (separate file)
```

**User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:
```bash
# Parallel between implementation and metrics:
Parallel Group:
  Task T022-T028: Dispatcher fan-out implementation (sequential within)
  Task T029-T030: Metrics instrumentation
```

**User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:
```bash
# Parallel between wrapper and orchestrator:
Parallel Group A:
  Task T036-T040: ConsumerWrapper implementation
  Task T041-T042: Metrics

Parallel Group B:
  Task T043-T044: Orchestrator recycling
```

**After Phase 2 Complete - User Stories Can Proceed in Parallel**:
```bash
# If team has capacity, all P1 and P2 stories can be worked simultaneously:
Developer A: User Story 1 (T022-T035)
Developer B: User Story 2 (T036-T051)
Developer C: User Story 3 (T052-T067) - starts after US2 tasks T036-T040 complete
Developer D: User Story 4 (T068-T081) - coordinates with Developer A on Dispatcher
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After Foundational phase complete, launch US1 implementation:
Sequential Group (Dispatcher core):
  Task T022: Audit existing code
  Task T023: Replace heap clones with pool duplicates
  Task T024: Implement parallel fan-out
  Task T025: Add cloneEvent() helper
  Task T026: Recycle original after fan-out
  Task T027: Optimize single-subscriber path
  Task T028: Recycle on zero subscribers

Parallel Group (Metrics - different file):
  Task T029: Add fan-out timing metrics
  Task T030: Add parallelism efficiency metric

Sequential Group (Tests):
  Task T031-T034: Unit tests
  Task T035: Benchmark
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Ensure Recycler is single return gateway per PERF-07
- Verify all async/pool usage eradicated per PERF-09
- Maintain existing component boundaries per LM-01 (no changes to Provider, Data Bus, Control Bus)
- Use github.com/sourcegraph/conc for all worker pools with proper error aggregation
- Critical events (ExecReport, ControlAck, ControlResult) must bypass filtering per PERF-08
- Enable debug mode in development/test builds; disable in production
- Run all tests with -race flag (explicit race detector test in T031b); verify ‚â•70% coverage
- Race detector must pass for parallel fan-out (T031b), consumer wrapper panic recovery (T047), and all integration tests
- Use context7 when looking up conc library documentation in Cursor/agents per GOV-06
