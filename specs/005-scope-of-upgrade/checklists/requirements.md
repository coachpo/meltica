# Specification Quality Checklist: Event Distribution & Lifecycle Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

All content is framed in terms of operational outcomes:
- User stories focus on "what" the system enables (parallel delivery, automatic cleanup, selective filtering, error handling)
- No mention of specific Go libraries or implementation patterns
- Readable by operations team and business stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

Requirements are concrete and testable:
- FR-001: "deliver events to multiple subscribers in parallel" - testable by measuring concurrent delivery
- FR-005: "single, centralized mechanism for returning events" - testable by verifying all code paths use same return mechanism
- FR-011-013: Critical event delivery guarantees - testable during topology flips
- All success criteria include specific metrics (15ms, 80% pool utilization, 100% delivery, zero leaks)
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (slow consumers, double-put, use-after-put, pool exhaustion, routing flips)
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- Assumptions section documents operational context
- Dependencies section lists existing system components

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

Feature is ready for planning:
- 4 user stories with clear priorities (2xP1, 2xP2) 
- Each story has independent test criteria
- 27 functional requirements organized by category
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Architecture diagrams provided (PlantUML)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "event delivery completes within 15ms" not "goroutine pool executes in 15ms")

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All validation items passed on first iteration
- No clarifications needed - feature scope is well-defined from NFR amendment context
- Architecture diagrams align with constitutional requirements (PERF-06, PERF-07, PERF-08, PERF-09)
