# External Tests

This directory contains external test applications and test data.

## Purpose

- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Test fixtures and data
- Performance/benchmark tests that require external setup

## Note

Unit tests should remain alongside the code they test using Go's convention of `*_test.go` files.
