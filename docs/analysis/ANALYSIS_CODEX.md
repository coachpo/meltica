# Meltica vs Production Auto-Trading Stack

## 1. Current Capabilities
- **Gateway orchestration** – `cmd/gateway/main.go` wires configuration loading, event bus, provider manager, dispatcher, lambda runtime, and control API.
- **Synthetic market data provider** – only `internal/adapters/fake` is registered (`internal/adapters/register.go`), supporting ticks, trades, book snapshots, and balance updates as configured in `config/app.example.yaml`.
- **In-memory pub/sub pipeline** – `internal/bus/eventbus` delivers canonicalised `schema.Event` objects with pooling (`internal/pool`) to minimize allocations.
- **Dispatcher with routing + dedupe** – `internal/dispatcher` tracks active routes and applies duplicate suppression, pushing events to subscribers while emitting OpenTelemetry metrics.
- **Lambda runtime & strategy catalog** – `internal/lambda/runtime` manages strategy lifecycles, exposes HTTP control plane (`internal/lambda/runtime/http.go`), and ships sample strategies (`internal/lambda/strategies`), including momentum, mean reversion, grid, delay, logging, and basic market making.
- **Telemetry hooks** – `internal/telemetry` initialises OTLP exporters; dispatcher and providers emit metrics/traces.
- **Configuration-driven bootstrap** – `config/app.yaml` (example file: `config/app.example.yaml`) defines exchanges, pools, event bus sizing, telemetry, and lambda manifest.
- **Testing scaffolding** – combination of package tests (`*_test.go` under `internal/*`), contract suites (`tests/contract`), and architecture checks.

## 2. Production-Grade Gaps

### Connectivity & Market Data
- No real exchange connectors, FIX/REST/WebSocket integrations, or certification harnesses; production systems require redundant connectivity to multiple venues.
- Lacks market data normalization for depth aggregation, kline generation, and corporate actions; only minimal schema conversions exist.
- No historical data ingestion, storage, or replay tooling for backfill, gap recovery, or analytics.

### Order & Execution Management
- No order state machine, persistence layer, or reconciliation against venue confirms; `provider.Instance.SubmitOrder` is effectively a stub for non-existent adapters.
- Missing routing rules for smart order routing, execution throttling, or venue selection logic.
- Absent risk controls: pre-trade checks (exposure, fat-finger, credit), post-trade reconciliations, and kill-switch/auto-hedging routines.
- No position, PnL, or inventory management; strategies cannot reason about account equity or net exposure.

### Strategy Lifecycle & Tooling
- Strategies are in-process Go structs without sandboxing, versioning, or dependency management; there is no deployment pipeline, blue/green rollout, or feature flagging.
- No backtesting, simulation, or walk-forward testing framework; synthetic provider is insufficient for validating real market behaviour.
- No support for machine learning workflows (data labeling, model training, feature stores) commonly present in advanced desks.

### Reliability & Operations
- Single-process, in-memory architecture; no clustering, horizontal scaling, or HA/DR story. Losing the process loses state, outstanding orders, and event queues.
- No durable messaging (Kafka, NATS, Redpanda) or persistence; resilience to restarts/outages is absent.
- Control API (`docs/lambdas-api.md`) is unauthenticated HTTP; production deployments need TLS, authZ/authN, rate limits, and audit logging.
- Limited observability: telemetry focuses on dispatcher metrics, but lacks structured logging, alerting, SLO dashboards, and runbook integration.
- Deployment assets are minimal; there is no infrastructure-as-code for the trading runtime, only telemetry notes (`deployments/telemetry`).

### Compliance, Governance, & Security
- No user management, secrets handling, or hardware security module integration for API keys.
- Missing compliance workflows: surveillance, trade reporting (CAT/MiFID/EMIR), reconciliations, and historical audit trail retention.
- Absence of change management, approvals, or segregation-of-duties controls that regulated desks require.

### Data Management
- No time-series storage, analytics warehouse, or real-time monitoring of PnL, Greeks, VaR, or stress metrics.
- Lacks data quality monitoring, schema evolution governance, and provenance tracking.

### Testing & Quality
- Unit/contract tests cover internal mechanics, but there is no end-to-end validation with real venues, chaos testing, latency benchmarking, or regression dashboards.
- No continuous integration or deployment configuration; production systems rely on automated build/test/deploy pipelines with gating policies.

## 3. Key Improvement Areas
- **Exchange connectivity** – implement authenticated adapters with order execution, state reconciliation, and certification artifacts; add health checks and failover.
- **Order/risk infrastructure** – build an OMS layer with persistence, risk limits, credit checks, and emergency stop/rollback paths.
- **Strategy platform** – provide sandboxed runtime (containers or WASM), versioned deployments, backtesting harness, and metric-driven evaluation.
- **Resilience & scalability** – externalize the bus to durable messaging, introduce cluster coordination, state recovery, and horizontal scaling.
- **Security & compliance** – enforce TLS and auth on control surfaces, integrate secrets management, add audit logging, trade surveillance, and regulatory reporting.
- **Operational tooling** – expand telemetry to full-stack monitoring (metrics, logs, traces), codify deployments (Kubernetes/Terraform), and define SLOs with alerting.
- **Data backbone** – persist tick/trade data, build analytics pipelines for risk/PnL, and support historical restatements and research access.
- **Testing rigor** – add CI pipelines, venue simulators, latency/load tests, and failure-injection to approach production confidence.

## 4. Overall Assessment
Meltica delivers a well-structured gateway skeleton with clear abstractions for events, routing, and strategy lifecycle, making it a solid foundation for experimentation and demonstrations. However, it lacks nearly every reliability, compliance, and operational capability required for production auto-trading—particularly around real exchange connectivity, risk management, persistence, and security. Significant engineering effort is needed to evolve this into a proven, production-ready system.
