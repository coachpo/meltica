# Analysis of the Meltica Codebase for Auto-Trading

This document outlines the current state of the Meltica codebase, comparing it to a production-ready automated trading system. It identifies existing features, critical gaps, and areas for improvement.

## 1. Present Features

The Meltica codebase provides a solid foundation for a trading application, with a focus on connectivity and data processing.

*   **Modular Architecture:** The project is built on a formal, four-layer architecture (Connection, Routing, Business, Filter), which promotes separation of concerns and scalability.
*   **Exchange Adapter Framework:** It includes a clear interface for exchange adapters (`internal/provider`) and a registration mechanism (`internal/adapters/register.go`). This design allows for extending the system to support multiple exchanges. A `fake` adapter is provided for testing purposes.
*   **WebSocket and REST Connectivity:** The connection layer is designed to handle both WebSocket and REST communication, which is essential for receiving real-time market data and executing trades.
*   **Real-time Data Routing:** The `dispatcher` (`internal/dispatcher`) is responsible for routing normalized payloads and managing subscriptions, forming the core of the real-time event processing engine.
*   **Trading Strategies (Lambdas):** The concept of "lambdas" (`internal/lambda/strategies`) provides a framework for implementing modular trading strategies. Several example strategies like `marketmaking`, `meanreversion`, and `momentum` are included.
*   **Observability:** The integration of OpenTelemetry for metrics and traces is a production-grade feature that enables monitoring and debugging.
*   **Strong Development Practices:** The project enforces high code quality through linting (`.golangci.yml`), a 70% test coverage requirement, and the use of high-performance libraries (`goccy/go-json`, `coder/websocket`).

## 2. Missing Features

While the foundation is strong, several critical components of a production-ready auto-trading system are missing.

*   **Live Execution Engine:** There is no concrete implementation of an order execution engine that can send, manage, and cancel live orders on an exchange. The current implementation is limited to a `fake` adapter.
*   **Risk Management:** The system lacks a dedicated risk management component. Production systems require robust risk controls to manage exposure, enforce position limits, and implement kill switches to halt trading during unexpected events.
*   **Strategy Backtesting Engine:** There is no functionality to test trading strategies on historical market data. This is a crucial feature for strategy development and validation.
*   **Persistent State Management:** The system does not have a database or other persistent storage mechanism. This is needed to store trade history, order status, and strategy state across application restarts.
*   **Secure API Key Management:** There is no secure mechanism for storing and accessing exchange API keys. In a production system, these should be encrypted and managed through a secure vault.
*   **Advanced Order Types:** The current schema appears to support basic order types, but a production system needs to handle a wide range of advanced order types (e.g., stop-limit, trailing stop, iceberg orders).
*   **Multi-Exchange Implementation:** While the architecture supports multiple exchanges, only a `fake` adapter is implemented. Integrating with real exchanges like Binance is a significant undertaking.

## 3. Areas for Improvement

The existing codebase could be improved in the following areas:

*   **Error Handling:** The `internal/errs` package provides a basic error-handling mechanism, but a more structured and granular approach would be beneficial for a trading system, where distinguishing between different types of errors (e.g., network error vs. invalid order) is critical.
*   **Configuration Management:** The configuration loading in `internal/config` could be enhanced with more robust validation and support for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
*   **Documentation:** While the code is well-structured, more detailed documentation for the internal APIs and data structures would improve maintainability and accelerate development.

## 4. Gaps to a Production-Ready System

The primary gap between the current Meltica codebase and a production-ready auto-trading system is the lack of a **live trading and risk management core**. The existing framework is essentially a sophisticated data pipeline and strategy container.

To bridge this gap, the following steps are necessary:

1.  **Implement a Live Exchange Adapter:** The first step is to build a full-featured adapter for a real exchange (e.g., Binance), including support for order placement, cancellation, and management.
2.  **Build an Execution and Risk Engine:** A robust execution engine is needed to manage the lifecycle of orders and a risk management module to enforce trading limits.
3.  **Develop a Backtesting Framework:** A backtesting engine is crucial for strategy development and validation before deploying capital.
4.  **Integrate Persistent Storage:** A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, InfluxDB) is required to store all trading activity and maintain state.
5.  **Harden Security:** Implement secure API key management and other security best practices.

In conclusion, the Meltica project is a well-architected foundation, but it is still in the early stages of development. Significant work is required to transform it from a data processing framework into a complete, production-ready automated trading system.
