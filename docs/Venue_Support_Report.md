## Venue Evaluation Framework

This framework is used to assess integration quality and prioritize engineering effort for new and existing venue integrations.

### A) Core Evaluation Dimensions

1. **API Quality & Stability**: docs completeness, versioning/semver, deprecations, SDKs, sandbox parity.
2. **Market/Feature Coverage**: spot/derivatives/options, margin/borrow‑lend, fiat on/off‑ramp, sub‑accounts.
3. **Market Data**: depth (L2/L3), trade feed, klines, sequencing/latency, gap‑fill tools, historical backfill.
4. **Trading Features**: order types (limit/market/IOC/FOK/POST‑Only/stop/oco), batch/cancel‑all, clientOrderId/idempotency.
5. **Performance & Rate Limits**: documented limits, burst vs sustained, reset behavior, WebSocket throughput.
6. **Reliability & Incident History**: uptime/SLA, major outages, maintenance comms, change‑management cadence.
7. **Integration Complexity**: auth/signing quirks, timestamp skew, precision/lot/tick rules, symbol churn/mapping.
8. **Operational Fit**: KYC/geo access, legal posture, treasury/withdrawals stability, fee schedule/rebates.
9. **Support & Ecosystem**: technical contacts, ticket SLA, community/forums, sample code.
10. **Security Posture**: past breaches, proof‑of‑reserves or attestations, 2FA/API key scopes, IP allowlists.

### B) Scoring Rubric (0–5 per dimension)

| Score | Description                                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **5** | Best‑in‑class; zero blockers; clean docs; stable WS with sequencing; rich order set; responsive support. |
| **4** | Strong; minor caveats or rare incidents; straightforward integration.                                    |
| **3** | Adequate; a few gaps/workarounds needed; acceptable reliability.                                         |
| **2** | Weak; frequent quirks or throttling; missing key features.                                               |
| **1** | Poor; unstable or inconsistent; major missing features.                                                  |
| **0** | Not usable now.                                                                                          |

**Suggested Weights** (sum to 1.0): API 0.2, Market/Feature 0.15, Market Data 0.15, Trading 0.15, Performance 0.1, Reliability 0.1, Integration 0.05, Operational 0.05, Support 0.03, Security 0.02.

**Composite Score** = Σ(scoreᵢ × weightᵢ). Document one‑line evidence per dimension.

### C) Mapping Scores to Integration Quality Ratings

* **Integration Quality**:
  * **✅** if Composite ≥ 4.0 and no critical risks.
  * **⚠️** if 3.0–3.9 or notable caveats (regulatory/geo, throttling, flaky WS).
  * **❌** if < 3.0 or critical blockers.
  * **❓** if not yet assessed.

### D) Evaluation Checklist (quick field guide)

* [ ] Docs cover auth, rate limits, order types, errors; changelog exists.
* [ ] Testnet available and near‑parity; sample API keys acquired.
* [ ] REST + WS smoke tests pass; sequencing & gap‑fill verified.
* [ ] Symbol/precision mapper validated; rounding rules unit‑tested.
* [ ] Rate‑limit strategy tuned; retries/backoff configured.
* [ ] Error taxonomy mapped; idempotency supported.
* [ ] Withdrawal/deposit flows tested; fees/rebates understood.
* [ ] Support contact verified; escalation path known.
* [ ] Security controls (IP allowlist, key scopes) enabled.
* [ ] Compliance/KYC/geo constraints documented.

> Tip: keep a per‑venue markdown file with the scores, evidence links, and gotchas; update after every incident or API change.
