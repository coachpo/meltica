# Build Artifacts

This directory contains packaging and Continuous Integration configurations.

## Structure

- `ci/` - CI configuration files (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.)
- `package/` - Packaging configurations (Docker, systemd, deb/rpm specs, etc.)

## Purpose

Maintain build and deployment configurations separate from source code for better organization.
